# Linear_Triangulation-
Reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) scene using information obtained from multiple two-dimensional (2D) images (In this exercise two images). The primary concept involves determining the 3D coordinates of points within a scene by intersecting their corresponding 2D projections captured from distinct viewpoints.
